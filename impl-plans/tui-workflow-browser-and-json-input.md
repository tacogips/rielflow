## Design Document Reference

**Source**:

- `design-docs/specs/design-tui.md`

### Summary

Expand `rielflow tui` from a workflow selector into a stateful workflow browser that can:

- browse workflows and historical workflow executions,
- inspect node-level inbox/outbox and execution logs,
- run and rerun workflows directly from the TUI,
- prefill rerun input from historical runtime state,
- switch input editing between text and JSON based on workflow-definition hints, with JSON formatting support.

Current reassessment:

- the browser, history inspection, JSON input editing, rerun, and resume behaviors remain the intended feature set
- the checked-in implementation now ships through the OpenTUI stack rooted in `src/tui/opentui-screen.ts` instead of the earlier `neo-blessed` screen path
- later Solid/OpenTUI follow-up work moved view composition into `src/tui/opentui-solid-app.tsx`, `src/tui/components/*.tsx`, and framework-neutral helpers such as `src/tui/opentui-model.ts`, but this plan still owns the product-scope behavior contract for workflow browsing and JSON-capable input editing

### Scope

**Included**:

- interactive TUI runtime dependency declaration for the checked-in OpenTUI stack
- richer interactive TUI state in `src/tui/opentui-screen.ts` plus the extracted screen-model helpers that now support it
- local CLI integration for run/rerun/resume callbacks in `src/cli.ts`
- targeted regression coverage for input-mode detection and runtime-variable construction

**Excluded**:

- web UI changes
- GraphQL/browser TUI parity
- live streaming execution progress inside the TUI event loop

## Modules

### 1. Interactive TUI Application

#### `src/tui/opentui-screen.ts`, `src/tui/opentui-model.ts`

**Status**: COMPLETED

```typescript
type TuiWorkflowInputMode = "json" | "text";

interface OpenTuiWorkflowAppOptions {
  readonly workflowNames: readonly string[];
  readonly loadWorkflowDefinition: (
    workflowName: string,
  ) => Promise<LoadedWorkflow>;
  readonly listWorkflowSessions: (
    workflowName: string,
  ) => Promise<readonly RuntimeSessionSummary[]>;
  readonly loadRuntimeSessionView: (
    sessionId: string,
  ) => Promise<RuntimeSessionView>;
  readonly loadManagerSessionMessages: (
    managerSessionId: string,
  ) => Promise<readonly ManagerMessageRecord[]>;
  readonly executeWorkflow: (input: {
    readonly workflowName: string;
    readonly runtimeVariables: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;
  }) => Promise<OpenTuiWorkflowExecutionHandle>;
  readonly rerunWorkflow: (input: {
    readonly sourceSessionId: string;
    readonly fromNodeId: string;
    readonly runtimeVariables: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;
  }) => Promise<OpenTuiWorkflowActionResult>;
  readonly resumeWorkflow: (
    sessionId: string,
  ) => Promise<OpenTuiWorkflowActionResult>;
}
```

**Checklist**:

- [x] Workflow list and historical session list render in one TUI flow
- [x] Node executions can be inspected per session
- [x] Inbox/outbox/log/manager-session details are visible from the details pane
- [x] Input editor supports text mode and JSON mode with JSON formatting
- [x] New run, rerun, and resume actions execute from the TUI

### 2. CLI Integration

#### `src/cli.ts`

**Status**: COMPLETED

```typescript
interface TuiRuntimeSessionView {
  readonly session: WorkflowSessionState;
  readonly nodeExecutions: readonly RuntimeNodeExecutionSummary[];
  readonly nodeLogs: readonly RuntimeNodeLogEntry[];
}
```

**Checklist**:

- [x] Interactive `tui` path invokes the richer OpenTUI workflow app first
- [x] TUI run/rerun callbacks merge `--variables` overrides correctly
- [x] TUI input now always maps plain text into `runtimeVariables.humanInput`
- [x] Interactive `--resume-session` opens the workflow browser on the target session when the workflow bundle is available
- [x] Readline fallback remains available when the OpenTUI screen cannot start

### 3. Targeted Regression Coverage

#### `src/tui/opentui-screen.test.ts`

**Status**: COMPLETED

```typescript
interface TuiWorkflowInputDetection {
  readonly mode: TuiWorkflowInputMode;
  readonly reason: string;
}
```

**Checklist**:

- [x] Text vs JSON input-mode detection is covered
- [x] TUI runtime-variable construction is covered
- [x] JSON formatting helper is covered

## Progress Log

### Session: 2026-03-25 10:20 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Agent-session history follow-up
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Extended the workflow-history node detail summary so agent-backed node executions now expose an AI session link row when the runtime has a persisted backend session id. Selecting that row opens a popup that loads stored `codex-agent` or `claude-code-agent` chat history from the local session stores, while existing JSON viewers remain in-pane. Also updated the TUI design spec/help text and added focused regression coverage for transcript loading plus the new summary-row logic.

### Session: 2026-03-24 12:10 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Selector-to-detail TUI redesign follow-up
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Reworked the interactive OpenTUI flow to match the updated design spec instead of opening directly into the all-pane browser. The initial screen is now a workflow selector with a dedicated preview pane plus `/`-triggered filter popup, and `enter` or `ctrl-m` transitions into a separate workflow-detail screen that shows sessions, nodes, details, and input/status controls. Added filter-helper regression coverage and re-ran the CLI/TUI regression slice with strict server typecheck.

### Session: 2026-03-24 10:40 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Post-implementation JSON input UX follow-up
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Tightened the workflow-browser TUI JSON editor behavior so the input panel now exposes JSON syntax state directly in the status area and input-panel title, and invalid JSON is rejected before run/rerun actions dispatch. Added regression coverage for text-mode, empty-buffer, valid-JSON, and invalid-JSON syntax-state reporting without disturbing the existing workflow/session/node browser flow.

### Session: 2026-03-23 17:24 JST

**Tasks Completed**: TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Replaced the selector-only interactive TUI with a richer workflow browser that can inspect workflow history, node inbox/outbox, and manager-session messages while launching new runs, reruns, and resumes from within the screen. Added TUI-side text/JSON input-mode detection plus JSON formatting, fixed interactive TUI runtime-variable construction so text input also flows through `humanInput`, declared the interactive TUI runtime dependencies in Bun, and verified the slice with server typecheck plus targeted CLI/TUI tests.

### Session: 2026-03-23 18:05 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Post-diff review follow-up
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Reviewed the pending diff as a continuation of the TUI browser work and found two concrete gaps. First, `design-docs/specs/design-tui.md` still described the older three-pane selector/timeline layout, so the design doc was updated to match the shipped four-pane workflow browser, JSON/text editor behavior, and actual keybindings. Second, the CLI wrapped the full-screen TUI in an over-broad fallback path that could hide real application errors as readline fallback; this was tightened so only interactive TUI package-availability failures degrade to readline while normal TUI bugs now surface. Also fixed the new session-store default-root test so it ignores the repo dev-shell `DIVEDRA_ARTIFACT_DIR` override when asserting the computed default path.

### Session: 2026-03-23 18:30 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Post-diff review hardening
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Continued the diff review and fixed two more quality issues. The computed default artifact-root path encoding now normalizes path-hostile characters so Windows-style drive letters and similar inputs do not produce invalid directory names under `~/.rielflow/project/...`. The interactive TUI fallback classifier was also narrowed again so only concrete module/widget availability failures fall back to readline. Finally, the implementation-tracking state was synchronized by marking phase 71 as completed in `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json`.

### Session: 2026-03-23 19:05 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Interactive resume-session TUI alignment
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: The post-diff review found that `rielflow tui --resume-session <id>` still forced the legacy fallback path even on interactive terminals, which contradicted the workflow-browser design. The CLI/runtime-mode flow now enters the full-screen TUI with the requested session preselected when the workflow definition is still available, while non-interactive or workflow-missing cases keep the direct resume fallback. Also tightened the TUI editor prefill logic so JSON-oriented historical sessions reopen from `promptJson`/`userPromptJson` rather than collapsing to text-oriented defaults.

### Session: 2026-03-23 19:25 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Neo-blessed resume fallback hardening
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Continued the same TUI/browser plan with one more post-diff correction. When the interactive workflow browser cannot start because the OpenTUI screen is unavailable, `rielflow tui --resume-session <id>` now preserves direct-resume behavior instead of dropping into the generic readline workflow prompt, which could not preserve the selected historical session. The CLI gained small TUI entrypoint dependency hooks so this fallback contract can be regression-tested directly.

### Session: 2026-03-23 19:50 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Mock-scenario fallback parity cleanup
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Reviewed the same TUI/browser diff for one more continuation bug and a maintainability issue. The full-screen interactive flow already auto-discovered workflow-local `mock-scenario.json`, but the direct fallback/resume branches did not, so identical `rielflow tui` commands could behave differently depending on whether the interactive TUI loaded. The CLI now routes interactive execution, rerun, resume, and fallback flows through shared local run-option assembly and shared mock-scenario resolution, and regression coverage now proves that `--resume-session` fallback still succeeds with only the workflow-local mock scenario present.

### Session: 2026-03-26 22:40 JST

**Tasks Completed**: Completed-plan reassessment
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Re-reviewed this completed plan after the Solid/OpenTUI migration landed. The behavior contract still matches the current product intent, but the plan text was stale because it still pointed at deleted `neo-blessed` paths. Updated the completed plan so future iterations correctly read it as the workflow-browser/JSON-input feature plan implemented today through the OpenTUI screen stack rather than through obsolete module names.
