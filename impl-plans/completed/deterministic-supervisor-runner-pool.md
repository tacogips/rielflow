## Design Document Reference

Step 3 accepted the revised issue-resolution design. This plan replaces the
stale process-manager plan with the clarified deterministic in-process
supervisor runner-pool model.

Source-of-truth behavior:

- The default supervisor is deterministic and represented by
  `rielflow-default-workflow-supervisor`.
- Event text is split only on spaces and tabs. A first token maps to a command
  only when it exactly matches a configured command string or alias; remaining
  tokens are preserved as ordered args.
- Empty text, whitespace-only text, or an unknown first token is natural
  language and routes to the command-analysis fallback node.
- Command-analysis returns a typed command or proposal. Runtime validation, not
  the LLM, remains the authority boundary for privileged actions.
- Target workflows start, resume, rerun, cancel, and inspect asynchronously
  in-process through `runWorkflow()`-compatible engine services.
- The runner pool tracks active workflow handles by runner-pool run id,
  supervised run id, workflow execution/session id, alias/workflow key, and
  event-source correlation.
- Durable run and command records are persisted before starting or mutating
  target workflow handles. Duplicate command ids replay stored command results.
- The local deterministic supervisor must not spawn a configured `rielflow`
  binary for lifecycle, inspection, or event-source command handling.
- Auto-improve remains separate: deterministic lifecycle supervision may enforce
  restart budgets, while workflow-definition patching occurs only when
  auto-improve is explicitly enabled.

Out of scope:

- Reintroducing `DIVEDRA_BINARY_PATH` or child-process supervisor lifecycle
  control.
- Broad `superviser` to `supervisor` renames outside touched control surfaces.
- Copying implementation from `../../codex-agent`.
- Provider adapter rewrites outside the supervisor command and runner-pool
  integration boundary.

## Codex-Agent Reference Mapping

Use local `../../codex-agent` references as behavior only:

- `../../codex-agent/src/sdk/session-runner.ts`: running-session lifecycle,
  active-session tracking, wait/cancel/interrupt facade, active-set pruning.
- `../../codex-agent/src/sdk/agent-runner.ts`: stable caller-facing async runner
  API and normalized event streaming.
- `../../codex-agent/src/sdk/mock-session-runner.ts`: deterministic async runner
  tests without real backend execution.
- `../../codex-agent/src/process/manager.ts`: negative/contrast reference only;
  do not implement rielflow workflow control by spawning a binary.
- `../../codex-agent/impl-plans/issue6-stable-runner-api.md`: stable runner API
  boundary planning.

Intentional divergences:

- Rielflow manages in-process workflow executions and supervised event/runtime
  records instead of Codex subprocesses.
- Rielflow persists command correlation in supervised-run records, event
  receipts, workflow sessions, and runtime DB rows.
- Cursor/Codex/backend-specific behavior remains behind existing workflow
  adapter modules.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Deterministic in-process runner-pool mode is the default local supervisor
      lifecycle path.
- [x] Event text parsing follows exact first-token command matching and ordered
      args preservation.
- [x] Unknown first-token text routes to command-analysis fallback and returns
      validated typed commands/proposals.
- [x] Event-source command surface covers start, status/progress, inbox/read,
      logs/export, stop/cancel, restart/rerun, and submit/input/resume.
- [x] Runner-pool starts, resumes, reruns, cancels, and inspects target workflows
      through in-process workflow-engine services.
- [x] Command/run records persist before mutation and support idempotent replay.
- [x] Run lookup works by supervised run id, alias, workflow key, workflow
      execution id, and event-source correlation.
- [x] Auto-improve patching remains explicit and separate from deterministic
      lifecycle supervision.
- [x] Required focused tests, typecheck, example validation, and stale-text
      checks pass.
- [x] Progress log is updated after each implementation session.

## Addressed Feedback

- Step 3 accepted the revised design with no remaining high or mid findings.
- Step 4 replaces the stale active process-manager plan because the accepted
  design explicitly rejects `rielflow` binary child-process lifecycle control.
- Step 2/3 feedback is carried into TASK-001 and TASK-005: unknown first-token
  text routes to command-analysis by default, while the supervisor remains
  deterministic.
- Step 2/3 feedback is carried into TASK-002 and TASK-004: local lifecycle
  control uses an in-process runner pool over `runWorkflow()`-compatible engine
  services.
- Step 2/3 feedback is carried into TASK-006: docs and examples must state that
  local deterministic lifecycle control does not shell out to a binary.
- Step 7 high finding on implicit auto-improve defaults is addressed by keeping
  library, CLI, and GraphQL execution auto-improve policy injection explicit
  only.
- Step 7 high finding on runner-pool liveness is addressed by starting
  `runWorkflow()` work through async engine hooks, storing the live task promise
  in runner-pool handles, and pruning terminal or rejected handles.
- Step 7 mid finding on command-map natural-language fallback is addressed by
  routing unknown first-token text to the default
  `rielflow-default-workflow-supervisor` `command-analysis` node when resolver
  settings are omitted.
- Step 7 follow-up high finding on async cancellation semantics is addressed by
  preserving stopped supervised-run records when background target execution
  observes cancellation.
- Step 7 follow-up mid finding on rerun/restart-from-step is addressed by
  interpreting the first command arg as `rerunFromStepId`, honoring
  `targetWorkflowExecutionId`, and passing an explicit target session id into
  `runWorkflow()`.
- Step 7 follow-up mid finding on progress/inbox/logs/export behavior is
  addressed by returning distinct typed command-result payloads for progress,
  inbox/read, and logs/export inspection commands.

## Risks

- Cancellation and resume semantics for live in-process handles may require
  engine hardening beyond status marking.
- Post-restart live-handle behavior is provisional: durable records remain
  inspectable, but live-only operations may need to refuse until safe resume is
  available.
- Command-analysis auto-apply thresholds are still tracked in user-QA and must
  remain policy-gated during implementation.
- Shared control paths with nested auto-improve superviser code may expose
  spelling and compatibility constraints.
- Concurrent event delivery can duplicate destructive actions unless command
  serialization and idempotency are implemented before router integration.

## Progress Log

### Session: 2026-05-06

**Tasks Completed**: Step 4 revised the active implementation plan after Step 3
accepted the deterministic in-process runner-pool design.

**Tasks In Progress**: None.

**Blockers**: Implementation and verification remain for later workflow steps.

**Notes**: Later TypeScript implementation must use the repository TypeScript
coding agent and must invoke check/test review after TypeScript file changes.

### Session: 2026-05-06 Step 6 Implementation

**Tasks Completed**: TASK-001 through TASK-007.

**Tasks In Progress**: None.

**Blockers**: None.

**Notes**: Implemented deterministic space/tab command parsing with ordered
args, command-analysis fallback dispatch, expanded supervisor action aliases,
runner-pool handle indexing/cancel refusal, command args persistence, local
event and GraphQL command dispatch through the runner-pool facade, library
exports, and example documentation. Verification passed with focused event,
workflow, GraphQL/server, CLI, example validation, typecheck, and stale-text
checks.

### Session: 2026-05-06 Step 6 Revision After Step 7 Review

**Tasks Completed**: TASK-002, TASK-005, TASK-006, TASK-007 revision pass.

**Tasks In Progress**: None.

**Blockers**: None.

**Notes**: Removed implicit default auto-improve injection from library, CLI,
and GraphQL execution paths; converted local and GraphQL supervised command
dispatch to persistent in-process runner-pool instances; made supervisor-client
start/input/restart paths publish running records immediately and execute target
workflows in background tasks when invoked through the runner pool; stored live
task promises in runner-pool handles with wait/cancel and terminal pruning; and
added default command-analysis fallback coverage for command-map natural
language.

### Session: 2026-05-06 Step 6 Second Revision After Step 7 Review

**Tasks Completed**: TASK-002, TASK-004, TASK-006, TASK-007 follow-up revision
pass.

**Tasks In Progress**: None.

**Blockers**: None.

**Notes**: Preserved stopped/cancelled supervised-run semantics for background
runner-pool task failures, implemented rerun-from-step dispatch using command
args and `targetWorkflowExecutionId`, allowed explicit session ids for engine
rerun/continuation entry points, and added typed command-result payloads for
progress, inbox/read, and logs/export commands with targeted tests.
