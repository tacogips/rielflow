# TypeScript Source Module Size Boundary Implementation Plan

**Status**: Completed
**Design Reference**: `design-docs/specs/architecture.md#typescript-source-module-size-boundary`
**Created**: 2026-05-13
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-13

## Source And Scope

This plan implements the accepted issue-resolution design for making local
Biome lint pass when `lint/nursery/noExcessiveLinesPerFile` enforces the
1000-line maximum for non-test TypeScript source files.

Issue reference:

- **Title**: Refactor over-1000-line TypeScript files so local Biome lint passes
- **Source**: `runtimeVariables.workflowInput`
- **Remote issue**: not available; no `issueUrl`, `issueNumber`, or
  `issueRepository` was supplied

Codex-reference mapping:

- No codex-agent reference repository, file paths, or behavior inputs were
  supplied.
- No Cursor adapter behavior is involved.
- Implementation should follow local rielflow behavior, tests, and the accepted
  architecture boundary instead of importing external reference behavior.

In scope:

- Split every non-test TypeScript source file reported by Biome
  `noExcessiveLinesPerFile` into cohesive modules.
- Preserve behavior and public import paths where practical with thin facade
  files that also stay under 1000 lines.
- Use meaningful file names that describe module responsibility.
- Update repository skill or user documentation only if the refactor makes
  documented paths, responsibilities, or workflow instructions stale.

Out of scope:

- Weakening or disabling Biome line-count enforcement.
- Runtime behavior changes unrelated to module extraction.
- Large style rewrites or formatting churn outside touched modules.

## Parallel Work

These tasks may run concurrently after TASK-001 because their planned write
scopes are disjoint:

- TASK-002: `src/cli.ts`, `src/cli/**`
- TASK-003: `src/graphql/schema.ts`, `src/graphql/schema/**`,
  `src/events/trigger-runner.ts`, `src/events/trigger-runner/**`
- TASK-004: `src/workflow/runtime-db.ts`, `src/workflow/runtime-db/**`,
  `src/workflow/supervisor-client.ts`, `src/workflow/supervisor-client/**`,
  `src/workflow/supervisor-dispatch-client.ts`,
  `src/workflow/supervisor-dispatch-client/**`
- TASK-005: `src/workflow/native-node-executor.ts`,
  `src/workflow/native-node-executor/**`, `src/workflow/node-addons.ts`,
  `src/workflow/node-addons/**`
- TASK-006: `src/workflow/validate.ts`, `src/workflow/validate/**`

TASK-007 is intentionally sequenced after TASK-004 through TASK-006 because the
workflow engine and direct-step implementation sit above those shared workflow
runtime surfaces.

## Verification Plan

Required commands:

- `bun run lint:biome`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test src/cli.test.ts`
- Focused `bun test` commands for touched `src/events`, `src/graphql`, and
  `src/workflow` tests selected during implementation.
- `bun run test` when focused tests do not cover changed public surfaces or
  when extraction crosses multiple workflow runtime areas.

Recommended audit commands:

- `rg -n "from ['\\\"](.*cli|.*graphql/schema|.*workflow/(engine|validate|runtime-db|node-addons|native-node-executor|supervisor-client|supervisor-dispatch-client|call-step-impl))" src`
- `wc -l` or Biome diagnostics for every touched non-test TypeScript facade.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All 11 known oversized non-test TypeScript source files are below 1000
      lines.
- [x] Public import paths remain stable where practical through thin facades.
- [x] Extracted modules have responsibility-based names and narrow import
      surfaces.
- [x] No circular imports or initialization-order regressions are introduced.
- [x] `bun run lint:biome` passes.
- [x] `bun run typecheck` passes.
- [x] Focused or full tests pass for the touched areas.
- [x] Progress log records commands run, results, residual risks, and any
      intentional documentation non-updates.

## Progress Log Expectations

Each implementation session must append:

- Date and workflow step or operator context.
- Tasks attempted and task status changes.
- Files created, moved, or left as compatibility facades.
- Verification commands run and pass/fail results.
- Any skipped verification with the concrete reason.
- Residual risks or follow-up TODOs with file paths.

## Progress Log

### Session: 2026-05-13 Step 4 Implementation-Plan Creation

**Tasks Completed**: Plan creation only.

**Notes**: Step 3 accepted the architecture design with no high or mid findings.
This plan keeps implementation under `impl-plans/active/` per workflow
instruction and records no codex-agent reference mapping because no reference
input was supplied.

### Session: 2026-05-13 Step 6 Implementation

**Tasks Completed**: TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-005,
TASK-006, TASK-007, TASK-008.

**Files Created, Moved, Or Left As Facades**: The 11 oversized public source
files were left as thin compatibility facades under their original import
paths: `src/cli.ts`, `src/events/trigger-runner.ts`,
`src/graphql/schema.ts`, `src/workflow/call-step-impl.ts`,
`src/workflow/engine.ts`, `src/workflow/native-node-executor.ts`,
`src/workflow/node-addons.ts`, `src/workflow/runtime-db.ts`,
`src/workflow/supervisor-client.ts`,
`src/workflow/supervisor-dispatch-client.ts`, and
`src/workflow/validate.ts`. Responsibility-based extracted modules were added
under `src/cli/`, `src/events/trigger-runner/`, `src/graphql/schema/`,
`src/workflow/call-step-impl/`, `src/workflow/engine/`,
`src/workflow/native-node-executor/`, `src/workflow/node-addons/`,
`src/workflow/runtime-db/`, `src/workflow/supervisor-client/`,
`src/workflow/supervisor-dispatch-client/`, and `src/workflow/validate/`.

**Verification Commands Run**:

- `bun run lint:biome` - passed; Biome checked 298 files with no fixes applied
  and no `noExcessiveLinesPerFile` diagnostics.
- `bun run typecheck` - passed.
- `bun test src/cli.test.ts src/graphql/schema.test.ts src/server/graphql-auth.test.ts src/server/graphql-execution-overview-and-definitions.test.ts src/server/graphql-supervision-and-resume.test.ts src/server/graphql-queries-and-inspection.test.ts src/events/trigger-runner-supervised.test.ts src/events/trigger-runner-supervisor-dispatch.test.ts src/events/trigger-runner-stickiness.test.ts src/workflow/call-step.test.ts src/workflow/call-step-impl-failures.test.ts src/workflow/call-step-impl-execution.test.ts src/workflow/engine.test.ts src/workflow/validate.test.ts src/workflow/runtime-db.test.ts src/workflow/supervisor-client.test.ts src/workflow/supervisor-graphql-client.test.ts src/workflow/native-node-executor-addons-commands.test.ts src/workflow/native-node-executor-gateway.test.ts src/workflow/superviser-control.test.ts src/workflow/superviser-runtime-control-impl.test.ts src/workflow/manager-control.test.ts`
  - passed; 462 tests across 22 files.
- `bun run test` - passed; 999 tests across 100 files.

**Notes**: `wc -l` confirmed all 11 original oversized facade files are far
below the 1000-line Biome limit, and all extracted non-test TypeScript modules
under the new split directories are below 1000 lines. Documentation updates were
limited to the accepted design and TypeScript coding-standard wording that
records the Biome line-count guardrail; no user-facing command behavior changed.

**Residual Risks**: Low. This is a broad source-organization refactor, so review
should focus on public export compatibility and initialization order, but
Biome, typecheck, focused tests, and the full test suite all passed.
