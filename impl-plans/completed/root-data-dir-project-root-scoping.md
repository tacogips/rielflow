# Root Data Dir Project-Root Scoping Implementation Plan

**Status**: Completed
**Design Reference**: `design-docs/specs/command.md`, `design-docs/specs/architecture.md`
**Created**: 2026-03-26
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-26

## Design Document Reference

**Source**: `design-docs/specs/command.md`, `design-docs/specs/architecture.md`

### Summary

Align default runtime data-root scoping with the documented project model: when no explicit root override is supplied, `DIVEDRA_ARTIFACT_DIR` should encode the nearest ancestor containing `.rielflow`, not the raw nested current working directory.

### Scope

**Included**:

- `src/workflow/paths.ts` default root-data-dir resolution
- regression coverage for nested working directories in `src/workflow/load.test.ts` and `src/workflow/session-store.test.ts`
- design/implementation-plan records describing the corrected default-scoping rule

**Excluded**:

- explicit `--artifact-root`, `--session-store`, or environment override behavior
- runtime-db co-location behavior for explicit storage roots
- TUI, GraphQL, or serve-mode behavior unrelated to default root selection

## Modules

### 1. Default Root-Data-Dir Resolution

#### `src/workflow/paths.ts`

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Checklist**:

- [x] Resolve the nearest `.rielflow` ancestor before computing the default root data dir
- [x] Keep explicit root overrides higher priority than inferred project scoping
- [x] Preserve existing path encoding rules for the selected project root

### 2. Regression Coverage and Documentation

#### `src/workflow/load.test.ts`, `src/workflow/session-store.test.ts`, `design-docs/specs/architecture.md`, `design-docs/specs/command.md`

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Checklist**:

- [x] Cover nested cwd resolution through the workflow-root loader path
- [x] Cover nested cwd resolution through the session-store path
- [x] Remove stale `<cwd-encoded>` wording from design docs where the implementation now scopes by project root

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Default root-data-dir scoping matches the documented nearest-project-root rule
- [x] Regression tests fail if nested working directories drift back to raw-cwd encoding
- [x] Design and implementation-plan artifacts match the shipped behavior

## Progress Log

### Session: 2026-03-26

**Tasks Completed**: Mismatch review, default-scoping fix, regression coverage, plan/doc updates
**Tasks In Progress**: None
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: The recent root-data-dir alignment work correctly handled explicit artifact/session roots, but the fallback path still encoded a nested working directory even when a nearer project root had already been discovered for workflow lookup. This follow-up aligns the default artifact/session/db tree with the documented project-root boundary so nested package directories stay inside one shared runtime scope.
