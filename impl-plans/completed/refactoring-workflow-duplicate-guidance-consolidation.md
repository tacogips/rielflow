# Refactoring Workflow Duplicate Guidance Consolidation Implementation Plan

**Status**: Completed
**Design Reference**: `refactoring-divide-and-conquer duplicate-scavenge slice reviews`
**Created**: 2026-05-19
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-19

---

## Design Document Reference

**Source**: Workflow `refactoring-divide-and-conquer`, Step 3 merge review plan, execution `div-refactoring-divide-and-conquer-1779158324-86ebc0fc`.

### Summary

Consolidate duplicated duplicate-scavenge guidance across the existing refactoring workflow bundles and exposed refactoring skill. The refactor must keep duplicate-scavenge as a mode of `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer`, preserve the existing child `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review` contract, and avoid creating a separate workflow or package.

### Scope

**Included**:

- Parent workflow prompt and node-schema wording that repeats duplicate-scavenge lifecycle, routing, and output-contract guidance.
- Parent Step 1 slicing guidance that should prioritize explicit `targetPaths` and `requestedOutcome` before package-boundary heuristics.
- Child slice-review prompt and fixture assertions that document the duplicate-scavenge evidence contract.
- Parent mock and expected-result fixtures that currently duplicate child slice-review fixture payloads.
- `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md` operator guidance that should summarize workflow-owned behavior without restating full schemas.

**Excluded**:

- Creating a duplicate-only workflow.
- Creating a provisioning package or shared prompt-include abstraction.
- Runtime TypeScript changes.
- Removing intentional safety repetition around read-only review, no staging, no commit, and no push.
- Changing public workflow route labels or adapter JSON field names except to clarify documented output contracts.

## Accepted Findings

| Finding ID | Severity | Slice ID | Summary | Task IDs |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| FIND-001 | mid | `parent-workflow-routing-schema` | Workflow-level duplicate-scavenge orchestration text repeats detailed phase guidance owned by step prompts and skill. | `REF-003` |
| FIND-002 | mid | `parent-workflow-routing-schema` | Parent node descriptions omit or drift from route-critical fields such as `no_plan_tasks`, `implementation_ready`, `no_review_slices`, `refactoringMode`, and final duplicate summary fields. | `REF-003` |
| FIND-003 | mid | `parent-workflow-prompts-loop` | Duplicate-scavenge evidence vocabulary drifts between child `behavioralDifferences`, Step 3 `behaviorToPreserve` / `knownDifferencesNotToCollapse`, and later phase wording. | `REF-002` |
| FIND-004 | mid | `parent-workflow-prompts-loop` | Step 4, Step 5, and Step 6 repeat guardrails with near-identical prose instead of referencing the canonical Step 3 task contract. | `REF-002` |
| FIND-005 | mid | `parent-workflow-prompts-loop` | Step 1 package/root-source slicing guidance can distract targeted workflow-bundle reviews from explicit target paths. | `REF-001` |
| FIND-006 | mid | `child-slice-review-bundle` | Child expected results assert only a narrow subset of the duplicateScavenge evidence fields consumed by Step 3. | `REF-004` |
| FIND-007 | mid | `child-slice-review-bundle` | Child prompt embeds a long generic adapter JSON example that can drift from child fixtures and parent Step 3 consumption. | `REF-005` |
| FIND-008 | mid | `refactoring-skill-parent-fixtures` | Parent mock embeds near-copy child slice-review payloads instead of keeping child fixtures canonical and parent fixtures parent-specific. | `REF-006` |
| FIND-009 | mid | `refactoring-skill-parent-fixtures` | Skill duplicate-scavenge section repeats workflow-owned schemas, constraints, and verification guidance with small wording differences. | `REF-006` |

## Rejected Findings

| Rejected ID | Source Slice ID | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| REJ-001 | all | Do not create a separate duplicate-scavenge workflow; operator constraints require this to remain a mode of the existing refactoring workflow. |
| REJ-002 | all | Do not add a provisioning package; no concrete provisioning source surface was identified. |
| REJ-003 | `child-slice-review-bundle` | Do not abstract away read-only/no-stage/no-cross-slice-write safety wording; repetition is intentional safety reinforcement. |
| REJ-004 | all | Do not add a shared prompt include mechanism; no existing workflow primitive supports includes, and introducing one would exceed a bounded wording refactor. |
| REJ-005 | all | Do not pursue cosmetic wording-only churn unless it directly supports route-field consistency, duplicate evidence preservation, or fixture contract stability. |

## Duplicate Groups

### DUP-001: Duplicate-Scavenge Evidence Contract

**Owner paths**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/step6-post-refactor-review.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/workflow-output.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/prompts/slice-review.md`

**Counterpart duplicate paths**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`
- `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md`

**Behavior to preserve**:

- Slice review emits duplicate evidence with counterpart paths, behavioral differences, consolidation target, confidence, risks, and verification suggestions.
- Step 3 groups child findings into implementation tasks only when owner paths, migration order, behavior to preserve, known differences not to collapse, conflicts, and verification are explicit.
- Steps 4 through 6 implement and review only the Step 3-authorized contract.

**Known differences not to collapse**:

- Child slice review records per-slice evidence; Step 3 records merged implementation tasks.
- Step 4 is implementation-scoped; Step 5 is self-review-scoped; Step 6 is independent gate-scoped.
- The skill is operator documentation and must not become the runtime behavior source.

**Consolidation target**: Step 3 duplicateGroups/task wording is the canonical downstream task contract; child prompt/fixtures remain canonical for per-slice evidence.

**Verification suggestions**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `git diff --check`

### DUP-002: Parent and Child Fixture Duplication

**Owner paths**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/mock-scenario.json`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`

**Counterpart duplicate paths**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/prompts/slice-review.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/step3-merge-review-plan.md`

**Behavior to preserve**:

- Child fixture proves the child slice-review evidence contract.
- Parent fixture proves parent fanout join, merge planning, routing, and final output.
- Parent Step 3 still receives enough representative child outputs to exercise duplicate grouping.

**Known differences not to collapse**:

- Parent fixture may need minimal embedded child outputs because fanout join requires payloads.
- Child fixture should assert full per-slice evidence fields; parent expected results should assert parent-specific aggregation.

**Consolidation target**: Child fixture is the canonical per-slice evidence fixture; parent fixture keeps only parent-flow assertions and minimal Step 3 input fields.

**Verification suggestions**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `git diff --check`

### DUP-003: Operator and Runtime Guidance Duplication

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/step1-slice-codebase.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/step3-merge-review-plan.md`
- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/prompts/workflow-output.md`

**Behavior to preserve**:

- Workflow route labels remain exact.
- Node descriptions remain concise indexes of runtime input/output fields.
- Skill remains useful operator guidance with explicit commands and constraints.

**Known differences not to collapse**:

- Runtime prompts are authoritative for worker behavior.
- Workflow JSON and node JSON provide discoverability and compact contract summaries.
- Skill documentation is human-facing and should not include every runtime schema detail.

**Consolidation target**: Runtime prompt contracts own detailed phase behavior; node/workflow JSON and skill docs summarize and point to exact route/field names.

**Verification suggestions**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`

- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: None

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Step 1 names explicit `targetPaths` and `requestedOutcome` as the first slicing authority.
- [x] Package/root-source slicing remains documented as the broad-refactor fallback.
- [x] Duplicate-search hints remain required when duplicate-scavenge intent is present.
- [x] No route labels or adapter field names change.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- Step 1 still needs broad package-boundary guidance for non-targeted refactors, so some package-first wording must remain.

### REF-002: Canonicalize Parent Duplicate-Scavenge Task Contract Wording

- `impl-plans/completed`
- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: None

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Step 3 duplicateGroups/task schema names the canonical downstream evidence fields.
- [x] Step 4 refers to the Step 3 task contract instead of restating alternate duplicate evidence names.
- [x] Step 5 self-review checks preserve counterpart paths, behavior to preserve, known differences not to collapse, consolidation target, conflicts, and verification.
- [x] Step 6 post-review gates on the same exact contract fields.
- [x] Final output prompt summarizes completed/blocked duplicate groups without redefining the child slice-review schema.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- No shared prompt include exists, so consolidation is through canonical references and field names rather than a single physical schema file.

### REF-003: Align Parent Workflow and Node Route/Output Descriptions

**Status**: Completed
**Parallelizable**: No
**Owned Files/Directories**:

- `dist`
- `node_modules`
- `impl-plans/completed`
- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: `REF-002`

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Workflow-level duplicate-scavenge description is concise and delegates detailed phase behavior to step prompts.
- [x] Manager node input/output descriptions include `refactoringMode` and preserve operator constraints.
- [x] Step 1 node output description names both `has_review_slices` and `no_review_slices`.
- [x] Step 3 node output description names `plan_only`, `no_plan_tasks`, `implementation_ready`, `has_plan_tasks`, `duplicateGroups`, and task DAG fields.
- [x] Final output node description names duplicate-scavenge summary, blocked tasks, residual risks, and verification results.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- Workflow JSON should retain a stable duplicate-scavenge mode marker so managers and operators can discover the mode.

### REF-004: Canonicalize Child Duplicate-Scavenge Fixture Assertions

**Status**: Completed
**Parallelizable**: Yes
**Owned Files/Directories**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json`

- `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md`
- `dist`
- `node_modules`
- `impl-plans/completed`
- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: None

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Child mock scenario remains the canonical per-slice duplicate-scavenge evidence fixture.
- [x] Expected results assert counterpart paths, behavioral differences, consolidation target, verification suggestions, conflict notes, and residual risks.
- [x] Fixture wording avoids parent-only aggregation concerns.
- [x] Existing child workflow mock scenario still passes.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- Parent fixtures may still embed minimal child output payloads because parent fanout and merge planning need representative inputs.

### REF-005: Condense Child Slice-Review Output Contract Wording

**Status**: Completed
**Parallelizable**: No
**Owned Files/Directories**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/prompts/slice-review.md`

- `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md`
- `dist`
- `node_modules`
- `impl-plans/completed`
- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: `REF-004`

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Long generic adapter JSON example is reduced to a concise child output contract.
- [x] Required fields remain explicit: findings, `duplicateScavenge`, proposed tasks, conflict notes, verification suggestions, and residual risks.
- [x] Prompt points concrete fixture expectations to child mock and expected-result files.
- [x] Parent Step 3 consumption remains compatible.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- Over-compressing the prompt can make worker output less predictable; keep required field names explicit.

### REF-006: Reduce Parent Fixture and Skill Duplication

**Status**: Completed
**Parallelizable**: No
**Owned Files/Directories**:

- `.rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/mock-scenario.json`

- `dist`
- `node_modules`
- `impl-plans/completed`
- `/tmp`

**Dependencies**: `REF-002`, `REF-003`, `REF-004`, `REF-005`

**Completion Criteria**:

- [x] Parent mock keeps only Step 3 input fields needed to exercise fanout join, merge planning, routing, and final output.
- [x] Parent expected results assert parent-specific aggregation rather than full child schema details.
- [x] Skill duplicate-scavenge section remains concise operator guidance and avoids restating full runtime schemas.
- [x] Skill command examples and verification guidance match workflow bundle wording.
- [x] Parent and child workflow mock scenarios pass after fixture updates.

**Verification Commands**:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`

- `git diff --check`

**Residual Risk Notes**:

- Over-compressing `SKILL.md` could reduce operator discoverability; the final skill keeps a compact runnable example and points to workflow-owned contracts.

## Verification Strategy

Run narrow verification after each task:

- Parent workflow-only tasks: `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- Child workflow-only tasks: `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- Fixture tasks: run the relevant `workflow run ... --mock-scenario ... --output json` command.
- Every implementation pass: `git diff --check`

Final verification:

- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-divide-and-conquer/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `bun run src/main.ts workflow run refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json --output json`
- `git diff --check`

## Exit Criteria

- [x] All accepted high/mid findings are completed or explicitly moved to accepted residual risk.
- [x] Duplicate groups `DUP-001`, `DUP-002`, and `DUP-003` have matching completed tasks or documented no-change decisions.
- [x] Parent and child workflow validations pass.
- [x] Parent and child mock scenarios pass when fixture or expected-result files change.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] No separate duplicate-scavenge workflow, provisioning package, or prompt-include abstraction is introduced.
- [x] Remaining low-only duplication is documented as accepted residual risk.

## Accepted Low Residual Risks

- Some no-stage, no-commit, no-push, and read-only safety wording intentionally remains repeated across workflow phases.
- Parent mock scenarios may retain minimal child-like payloads because fanout join and merge planning need representative inputs.
- No shared prompt include mechanism exists; canonical references reduce drift but cannot enforce physical single-source prompt snippets.

## Progress Log

### Session: 2026-05-19 11:24

**Tasks Completed**: Plan creation from Step 3 merge review.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Merged four slice-review outputs from `parent-workflow-routing-schema`, `parent-workflow-prompts-loop`, `child-slice-review-bundle`, and `refactoring-skill-parent-fixtures`; accepted nine mid-severity findings into six bounded tasks.

### Session: 2026-05-19 11:48 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-001`.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Updated Step 1 slicing guidance so explicit `targetPaths` and `requestedOutcome` are the first slicing authority, with package/root-source slicing retained as the broad-refactor fallback. Duplicate-scavenge guidance now preserves that target-first authority before adding duplicate-oriented review questions and search hints.

### Session: 2026-05-19 11:51 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-001` revision.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Updated `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` so phase 180 is `IN_PROGRESS`, plan `active/refactoring-workflow-duplicate-guidance-consolidation` is `In Progress`, and `REF-001` is `Completed`, matching the plan markdown state after self-review requested metadata consistency.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:04 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-001` revision.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Updated `impl-plans/README.md` so the active plan index records `active/refactoring-workflow-duplicate-guidance-consolidation` as `In Progress`, matching the plan markdown and `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` states requested by self-review finding `SELF-REF-002`.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:18 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-002`.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Canonicalized the parent duplicate-scavenge downstream contract in Step 3 and updated Steps 4 through 6 plus final output to reference the Step 3 duplicate group/task fields instead of restating variant evidence wording. Verification recorded with parent workflow validation and `git diff --check`.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:24 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-003`.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Aligned parent workflow and node descriptions with route-critical fields: workflow-level duplicate-scavenge wording now delegates detailed phase behavior to step prompts, manager metadata preserves `refactoringMode`, Step 1 names both fanout routes, Step 3 names route booleans plus `duplicateGroups` and task DAG fields, and final output names duplicate-scavenge summaries, blocked tasks, verification results, and residual risks. Verification passed with `bun run src/main.ts workflow validate refactoring-divide-and-conquer --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows --output json` and `git diff --check`.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:30 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-004`.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Canonicalized the child duplicate-scavenge fixture assertions by keeping the child mock focused on per-slice evidence, removing parent-only merge ownership wording from conflict notes, and expanding expected-result highlights to assert counterpart paths, behavioral differences, consolidation target, verification suggestions, conflict notes, and residual risks. Verification passed with child workflow validation, child mock-scenario execution, and `git diff --check`.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:35 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-005`.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Condensed the child slice-review prompt by replacing the long generic adapter JSON example with a concise child output contract. Required fields remain explicit for findings, `duplicateScavenge`, proposed tasks, conflict notes, verification suggestions, and residual risks, and fixture-level examples are now delegated to the child mock scenario and expected-results files. Verification passed with child workflow validation, child mock-scenario execution, and `git diff --check`.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:44 JST

**Tasks Completed**: None.
**Tasks In Progress**: `REF-006` partial.
**Blockers**: `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md` is not writable in the current sandbox (`Operation not permitted`), so skill duplicate-scavenge guidance could not be condensed.
**Notes**: Reduced the parent mock scenario to minimal child fanout payloads needed for Step 3 planning context and updated parent expected results to assert parent aggregation fields instead of child schema details. Verification passed with parent and child workflow validation, parent and child mock-scenario execution, and `git diff --check`. `REF-006` remains blocked until the exposed skill file can be edited.

### Session: 2026-05-19 12:52 JST

**Tasks Completed**: `REF-006`; plan complete.
**Tasks In Progress**: None.
**Blockers**: None.
**Notes**: Parent process had write access to `.agents/skills/rielflow-refactoring-workflow/SKILL.md`, so the skill duplicate-scavenge section was condensed to operator guidance that points to Step 1, child slice-review evidence, Step 3 duplicate groups, and Steps 4 through 6 review contracts instead of restating runtime schemas. Plan exit criteria are complete and the plan is ready for archival under `impl-plans/completed/`.
