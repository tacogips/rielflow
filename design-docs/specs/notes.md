# Design Notes

This document captures additional design notes for cooperative multi-agent orchestration.

## Overview

The project uses workflow-driven coordination where agent behavior is explicit and auditable.

## Notable Decisions

### Primary Agent Providers

Initial design scope includes exactly two CLI execution backends:

- `codex-agent`
- `claude-code-agent`

### Prompt Decomposition

Prompt payloads are separated into:

- `promptTemplate`: reusable template
- `variables`: runtime-resolved data

This enables deterministic replay and easier session debugging.

Additional input assembly policy:

- Keep prompt rendering simple (`mustache`-style substitution).
- Build complex runtime payloads as structured `arguments` via explicit bindings.
- Avoid logic-heavy template engines (for example full Handlebars helper flow) in core runtime paths.

### Workflow File Split

Workflow data is intentionally split:

- `workflow.json`: structure/control, workflow `description`, and node ordering
- `node-{id}.json`: runtime payload (`executionBackend`, `model`, `promptTemplate`, `variables`)

This keeps derived visualization state out of separate authored files.

### Deterministic Control Flow

Workflow JSON must make control flow explicit:

- graph edges for transitions
- branch conditions
- loop policies and loop-judge nodes

Implicit transitions are avoided.

### Confirmed Runtime Policies

- Branch behavior: fan-out to all matched branches.
- Loop limit fallback: use workflow global default when loop-local limit is omitted.
- Completion: auto-complete nodes are allowed; success-judgment-free nodes can be configured.
- Timeout: each node can define execution timeout, with workflow-level default fallback.
- Conversation handoff: `divedra` routes by explicit `OutputRef` (`workflowExecutionId`, `outputNodeId`, `nodeExecId`, and optional `subWorkflowId` for sub-workflow outputs) instead of implicit latest-output inference.
- Node mailbox transport: messages are persisted as hierarchical manager-routed file mailboxes with per-workflow-execution `communicationId` allocation owned by the root workflow manager. The parent workflow manager writes only to the recipient sub-workflow manager inbox, and the recipient sub-workflow manager writes only to nodes inside that sub-workflow (validated via `subWorkflows[].nodeIds`). A re-executed/resubmitted send always allocates a new `communicationId`; delivery retries for an already-created send keep the same `communicationId` and advance `deliveryAttemptId` (and optional `agentSessionId`). See `design-docs/specs/design-node-mailbox.md`.
- Node execution inbox contract: canonical mailbox transport stays manager-owned, but workers receive one compiled execution-local inbox/outbox contract under their node artifact directory. The worker-facing metadata uses mailbox-root-relative paths plus `DIVEDRA_MAILBOX_DIR`, so node implementations do not need hidden knowledge of workflow graph shape or canonical `communications/...` layout. See `design-docs/specs/design-node-execution-inbox-contract.md`.
- GraphQL control-plane direction: GraphQL is now the canonical served control-plane schema for execution, communication inspection/replay, manager send operations, and workflow/session control flows. CLI may remain as a thin client surface over GraphQL. See `design-docs/specs/design-graphql-manager-control-plane.md`.
- Manager control-plane separation: a manager-issued GraphQL manager-message mutation invoked through `divedra gql` is not itself a mailbox communication. It is a scoped control-plane request that may cause new mailbox communications, retries, planner-state changes, or node execution requests.
- Manager-message provenance: manager-authored mailbox sends now use discriminated `payloadRef` provenance so node-output-backed and manager-message-backed communications stay replay/retry compatible under one durable artifact model.
- File/image reference portability: GraphQL must use data-root-relative file references resolved under `DIVEDRA_ARTIFACT_DIR`, never host absolute paths. This is required for future container node execution with bind-mounted or synchronized data volumes regardless of whether the selected runner is Podman, Docker, nerdctl, or Apple container.
- Manager attachment scope: manager-scoped GraphQL attachments are not just root-data-relative; they must stay inside the authenticated execution's `files/{workflowId}/{workflowExecutionId}/...` namespace so manager messages cannot read unrelated workflow artifacts or session files.
- Root-data note: `DIVEDRA_ARTIFACT_DIR` is the canonical root data directory for derived workflow artifacts, session state, attachments, and the runtime database.
- Manager kind naming direction: the authored workflow schema should keep an explicit root-vs-sub-workflow manager split, but the nested kind should be neutral (`subworkflow-manager`) instead of product-branded (`sub-divedra-manager`). Detailed scope is tracked in `design-docs/specs/design-manager-kind-simplification.md`.
- Workflow role unification direction: future design work should collapse authored node roles to `manager` and `worker`, make workflow managers optional, and treat called workflows as ordinary workflows rather than as structural sub-workflow boundaries. This supersedes the manager-kind split direction for future architecture work. Detailed scope is tracked in `design-docs/specs/design-unified-workflow-role-model.md`.
- Workflow JSON simplification direction: future design work may go further and make `workflow.json` linear-by-default, remove required `edges[]`, replace `subWorkflows[]` with node-owned workflow-call semantics, and use node-local skip/repeat controls instead of general graph authoring for common cases. Detailed scope is tracked in `design-docs/specs/design-simplified-workflow-json.md`.
- `divedra gql` variables contract: GraphQL variables are passed through `--variables`, which accepts inline JSON or `@path/to/variables.json`. First-iteration attachment handling assumes files are pre-placed under the Divedra root data directory; no upload mutation is introduced yet.
- GraphQL transport contract: `/graphql` accepts standard JSON request envelopes with `query` and optional `variables`, and `divedra gql` defaults to the local serve endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:43173/graphql` unless `--endpoint` or `DIVEDRA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` overrides it.
- Manager action contract: execution-affecting manager requests must use typed GraphQL actions. Freeform text may be retained for audit notes, but must not be the only source of truth for privileged control decisions.
- Manager auth/idempotency contract: GraphQL manager mutations use a runtime-issued bearer token scoped to one manager session and enforce persisted idempotency by `(mutationName, managerSessionId, idempotencyKey)`.
- Manager message identity contract: `managerMessageId` must be allocated with collision-safe opaque ids so concurrent `sendManagerMessage` requests cannot reuse the same append-only message record.
- Manager runtime session lifecycle: manager-node executions mint a scoped GraphQL manager session at runtime, pass the ambient control-plane environment only to manager-capable adapters, and expire the token when the step ends. See `design-docs/specs/design-graphql-manager-runtime-session-lifecycle.md`.
- Manager control-mode exclusivity: each manager execution persists one authoritative control source, so `sendManagerMessage` and payload `managerControl` cannot both drive the same manager step; the control-mode claim itself must be atomic at the storage boundary.
- Node output ingestion contract: ordinary node completion is runtime-captured in the execution path itself, not discovered by periodic scanning for `output.json` files. File watching is only an adapter-local fallback for special external backends and must still feed results back into the runtime-owned completion path.
- Timeout inspection fallback: if the normal transition/notification path fails, Divedra still needs a deterministic inspection path for node `status`, published `output.json`, `meta.json`, and timeout/failure messages via GraphQL `nodeExecution(...)` or internal runtime-db/session helpers.
- Container runtime contract: container nodes may declare either a prebuilt `image` or a workflow-local `build` block with `contextPath` and optional `containerfilePath`, plus workflow-level runner defaults. Runtime behavior and authoring rules are specified in `design-docs/specs/design-container-runtime-contract.md`.
- User escalation contract: add `nodeType: "user-action"` as a runtime-owned human interaction executor that fans out through registered message/notification tools selected by logical tool id, validates the normalized reply against the node `output` contract, and resumes the paused workflow on acceptance. Optional node execution should be modeled separately as manager-owned scheduler policy on `workflow.json.nodes[]` rather than as a node payload executor concern. See `design-docs/specs/design-user-action-and-optional-node-execution.md`.
- Node add-on contract: `workflow.json.nodes[]` may reference built-in worker add-ons with `addon` instead of `nodeFile`; the loader resolves them into effective node payloads while save/edit surfaces preserve the authored reference. Built-in add-ons currently include `divedra/chat-reply-worker` for provider-neutral event replies, `divedra/codex-worker` and `divedra/claude-code-worker` for reusable agent-backed workers, `divedra/x-gateway-read` for read-only x-gateway GraphQL inspection through an explicit container runner binding, `divedra/x-gateway` for intentional x-gateway GraphQL query or mutation execution such as X post creation, `divedra/mail-gateway-read` for read-only mail-gateway GraphQL inspection, and `divedra/mail-gateway` for intentional mail-gateway GraphQL query or send-mutation execution. `addon.inputs` supplies invocation-specific node variables, and only descriptors that consume explicit environment bindings may accept `addon.env`; required add-on env sources are runtime readiness prerequisites. See `design-docs/specs/design-node-addon-catalog-and-chat-reply-worker.md`.

### Completion-First Progression

A node should not transition until completion criteria are evaluated.
This supports quality gates in collaborative writing workflows.

### Open Items

- See `design-docs/qa.md` for current decision status and any remaining confirmation items.

### GraphQL Redesign Decision

- The requested GraphQL-first redesign does not conflict with the current execution/mailbox architecture.
- It does conflict with the current CLI/control-surface layering if attempted as a direct in-place replacement.
- The approved direction is therefore additive and layered:
  - keep workflow/session/mailbox artifacts,
  - introduce GraphQL as the canonical control plane,
  - expose `divedra gql` as the manager tool client over that control plane,
  - add first-class communication inspection and replay services,
  - keep CLI only as a thin GraphQL client surface,
  - keep served workflow-definition and execution flows on GraphQL rather than reintroducing parallel REST routes.

### Migration Rule

- Existing workflow-run `sessionId` in runtime/session-store code is the old name for `workflowExecutionId`.
- New design docs must use `workflowExecutionId` for workflow-run scope and `agentSessionId` for worker retry scope.
- New API and persistence changes should not introduce fresh `sessionId` surface area for workflow runs.

### Documentation Cleanup Note

- Browser-editor and browser-asset design documents were removed after the Web UI implementation was deleted from the repository.
- Remaining design notes in `design-docs/specs/` should describe the current CLI, GraphQL, runtime, and TUI surfaces only.
