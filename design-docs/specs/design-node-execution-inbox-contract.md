# Node Execution Inbox Contract

This document defines the worker-facing execution contract that the runtime
materializes for every node execution.

## Overview

Canonical mailbox transport remains manager-owned and lives under
`communications/{communicationId}/...`.

That transport shape is not the primary API for worker implementations.
Instead, before a node executes, the runtime compiles workflow metadata,
resolved input, and output expectations into one execution-local inbox/outbox
contract.

Goals:

- give `agent`, `command`, and `container` nodes one shared worker-facing ABI
- remove implicit dependence on workflow graph or canonical mailbox layout
- let node implementations read one metadata file and one input payload file
- keep canonical mailbox publication, routing, and validation runtime-owned
- keep host filesystem paths out of container-facing metadata
- make the worker-facing execution boundary format-stable and machine-readable

## Execution-Local Layout

Each node execution artifact directory gains a worker-facing mailbox subtree:

```text
{artifact-root}/{workflowId}/executions/{workflowExecutionId}/nodes/{nodeId}/{nodeExecId}/
  input.json
  output.json
  meta.json
  handoff.json
  mailbox/
    inbox/
      meta.json
      input.json
      files/
    outbox/
      output.json        # worker target path; runtime-owned publication still applies
      files/
```

Rules:

- `mailbox/inbox/meta.json` is the primary worker-facing execution contract
- `mailbox/inbox/input.json` contains the resolved execution-local input payload
- `mailbox/inbox/files/` contains worker-visible input files for that execution
- `mailbox/outbox/output.json` is the preferred worker write location for
  candidate output; after runtime validation and publication, the runtime
  overwrites this file with the runtime-published envelope so that the
  execution-local outbox always reflects the final published state
- for structured-output nodes, the adapter uses a reserved staging path for
  candidate submission rather than writing directly to `mailbox/outbox/output.json`;
  the runtime still copies the published envelope to `mailbox/outbox/output.json`
  after validation
- `mailbox/outbox/files/` is the preferred worker output-files directory
- worker-facing mailbox paths are execution-local and must not be treated as the
  canonical routed mailbox store
- worker-facing `inbox/input.json` and `outbox/output.json` are always JSON
  files; workers do not need to branch on plain text versus JSON at this ABI

## JSON Boundary Rule

The execution-local inbox/outbox ABI is JSON-only.

Rule:

- plain text may appear at ingress edges such as CLI/user input, GraphQL string
  fields, or raw backend/model responses
- the runtime must normalize those values into canonical JSON before writing
  `mailbox/inbox/input.json`
- workers may return plain text to an adapter-specific boundary; output
  normalization rules are defined in `design-node-output-contract.md`
- workers must not be required to guess whether `inbox/input.json` is text or
  JSON based on node type, backend, or manager behavior

Input normalization shape:

- `mailbox/inbox/input.json` always retains the top-level resolved-execution
  structure with fields such as `arguments`, `humanInput`, `upstream`,
  `runtimeVariables`, and `managerMessage`; plain-text normalization never
  replaces the whole document
- normalization applies at the leaf payload position within each field:
  - `humanInput` value becomes `{"text":"..."}` when the source was plain text
  - each `upstream[].payload` item becomes `{"text":"..."}` when the upstream
    node produced semantically plain-text output
  - `managerMessage.payload` becomes `{"text":"..."}` when the manager message
    body was plain text
  - `arguments` and `runtimeVariables` are always structured by definition and
    are never subject to plain-text wrapping
- the canonical plain-text wrapper is `{"text":"..."}`, consistent with the
  output-side canonical shape defined in `design-node-output-contract.md`

Output normalization:

- output normalization rules and the canonical published output shape are defined
  in `design-node-output-contract.md`; this document does not override those
  rules

Rationale:

- a fixed JSON ABI keeps `agent`, `command`, and `container` execution aligned
- runtime validation, replay, and inspection remain uniform
- future non-agent managers or command-driven managers can rely on the same
  contract without hidden prompt conventions

## Path Contract

Worker-visible metadata must use mailbox-root-relative paths, not host absolute
paths.

The runtime may mount or expose the mailbox root differently per executor.

Preferred rule:

- the executor sets `RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR`
- metadata paths are relative to that directory
- worker code joins `RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR` with the relative paths declared in
  `mailbox/inbox/meta.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "mailboxDirEnvVar": "RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR",
  "paths": {
    "inputPath": "inbox/input.json",
    "inputFilesDir": "inbox/files",
    "outputPath": "outbox/output.json",
    "outputFilesDir": "outbox/files"
  }
}
```

This keeps host/container path differences out of the public worker contract.

## `mailbox/inbox/meta.json`

`meta.json` answers four worker questions:

1. Why is this node running?
2. What input did it receive?
3. What files are available?
4. What output should it produce and where should it write it?

Example shape:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "mailboxDirEnvVar": "RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR",
  "node": {
    "workflowId": "release",
    "workflowDescription": "Ship a release safely.",
    "nodeId": "implement",
    "nodeKind": "task"
  },
  "objective": {
    "reason": "Execute the assigned work step because it contributes a required intermediate result in the workflow.",
    "expectedReturn": "Return the business JSON object produced by this work step for downstream consumers.",
    "instruction": "Implement the release step."
  },
  "paths": {
    "inputPath": "inbox/input.json",
    "inputFilesDir": "inbox/files",
    "outputPath": "outbox/output.json",
    "outputFilesDir": "outbox/files"
  },
  "input": {
    "kind": "json",
    "upstreamSources": [
      {
        "fromNodeId": "workflow-input",
        "communicationId": "comm-000014",
        "transitionWhen": "always"
      }
    ]
  },
  "output": {
    "kind": "json",
    "required": true,
    "path": "outbox/output.json",
    "filesDirectory": "outbox/files"
  }
}
```

Additional optional sections may include:

- current sub-workflow scope summary
- manager-owned child catalog
- manager control guidance
- output JSON Schema hints for structured-output nodes

## `mailbox/inbox/input.json`

`input.json` carries resolved execution data rather than transport internals.

Initial fields:

- `arguments`
- `humanInput`
- `workflowOutput`
- `runtimeVariables`
- `upstream`
- `latestOutputs`
- `managerMessage`

Rules:

- upstream payloads included here are execution-local resolved data, not
  canonical mailbox envelopes
- `latestOutputs` carries the latest completed node execution records available
  to the current step, including step id, node id, node execution id, status,
  artifact directory, and structured payload; prompt summaries may truncate this
  data, but `mailbox/inbox/input.json` must retain the full structured records
- the runtime may keep richer audit data in the root `input.json`, but worker
  code should not need that file
- workers must not read canonical `communications/...` directories directly
- if an ingress source was semantically plain text, the runtime must normalize
  it into a `{"text":"..."}` object at the leaf payload position within the
  relevant field (see JSON Boundary Rule above) rather than emitting a raw text
  file or replacing the top-level `input.json` document

## Backend Application

All node types use the same semantic contract:

- `agent`
  - runtime compiles `mailbox/inbox/meta.json` and `mailbox/inbox/input.json`
  - prompt composition must be derived from that same compiled contract
- `command`
  - future executor should expose the same mailbox tree on disk and set
    `RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR`
- `container`
  - future executor should mount the same mailbox tree and set
    `RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR`

Normalization happens before this backend boundary. A `command` or `container`
worker should see the same JSON inbox shape as an `agent` worker even if the
original upstream source was plain text or the eventual backend response is raw
text.

This keeps worker semantics aligned even if execution mechanisms differ.

## Real-Backend Artifact Audit Requirements

Issue mapping: `Verify non-mock impl-plan implementation workflow execution`.
The `design-and-implement-review-loop` workflow must be auditable when run in
`issue-resolution` workflow mode with real configured LLM backends such as
`codex-agent`, not a mock scenario.

For each runtime step, the persisted node execution artifacts must let a later
review or summary step prove:

- which execution backend and model were requested
- which mailbox contract was materialized at `mailbox/inbox/meta.json`
- which full resolved input was materialized at `mailbox/inbox/input.json`
- which prompt/request was sent to the backend for each output attempt
- which candidate payload was received or staged for each output attempt
- which validation result accepted or rejected the candidate when an output
  contract applies
- which final runtime-owned `output.json`, `meta.json`, and `handoff.json`
  records were published for the node execution

Prompt text sent to an agent backend is an inspectable derivative of the
mailbox contract, not a separate source of truth. When prompt text summarizes
large upstream payloads, it must explicitly point workers and reviewers to
`RIEL_MAILBOX_DIR` and `mailbox/inbox/input.json` for full structured
records. Downstream review steps must rely on `latestOutputs` in
`mailbox/inbox/input.json` for complete prior-step data rather than on truncated
prompt snippets.

Mock scenarios remain valid for deterministic tests and examples, but a
non-mock audit run must not accept mock-scenario responses as evidence that
configured LLM backends were exercised. Runtime artifacts should make that
distinction explicit through provider/backend metadata and request records.

Codex-reference mapping:

- local reference root: `<reference-repository-root>` (for example `../../codex-agent`)
- relevant reference behavior:
  `<reference-repository-root>/design-docs/specs/design-codex-session-management.md`
  describes Codex rollout/session audit records and
  `<reference-repository-root>/src/sdk/session-runner.ts` exposes
  `SessionConfig`, `RunningSession`, and streamed rollout messages
- intentional rielflow boundary: rielflow keeps workflow mailbox, validation,
  routing, and final publication runtime-owned; `codex-agent` is used as a
  backend session/process adapter and as an auditability reference, not as the
  workflow mailbox or session store
- Cursor-specific or CLI-specific behavior must stay behind adapter modules so
  the worker-facing mailbox ABI stays stable across `codex-agent`,
  `claude-code-agent`, SDK, command, and container execution

## Output Ownership

The worker-facing mailbox does not change publication ownership:

- workers may write only to execution-local outbox targets
- runtime validates and promotes accepted output into canonical `output.json`
- runtime alone creates downstream mailbox communications
- canonical `communications/{communicationId}/...` layout remains internal

For structured-output nodes, executor-specific candidate temp paths may still
exist as internal runtime plumbing. They are not part of the stable worker ABI.

## File Handling

File transfer follows the same principle:

- input files appear under `mailbox/inbox/files/`
- output files are written under `mailbox/outbox/files/`
- metadata uses relative paths under the mailbox root
- workers do not receive host absolute file paths

Future versions may widen the manifest structure, but v1 should keep file usage
simple enough that no SDK is required for basic scripting.

## Relationship To Canonical Mailbox Transport

The execution inbox contract is not a replacement for the canonical mailbox
transport design.

The layering is:

1. managers route canonical communications under `communications/...`
2. runtime resolves those communications into one node execution
3. runtime compiles one worker-facing mailbox contract for that execution
4. worker writes an execution-local outbox result
5. runtime validates, publishes, and routes downstream
