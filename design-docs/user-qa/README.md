# User Q&A

This directory contains items requiring user confirmation or decision.

## Purpose

Store questions, pending decisions, and items awaiting user approval.

## File Naming Convention

| Prefix     | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| `qa-`      | Questions/confirmation items |
| `pending-` | Pending decisions            |

## Current Items

- `qa-event-supervisor-control.md`: public naming, default restart limit,
  chat command structure, multi-run correlation, and cancellation propagation
  decisions for event-driven workflow supervisor control.
- `qa-matrix-event-source.md`: receive transport, rich Matrix event scope,
  reply threading, token/identity, and sync-state retention decisions for
  Element/Matrix event sources.
- `qa-chat-sdk-event-sources.md`: direct Chat SDK dependency policy, provider
  rollout depth, web provider scope, and rich interaction normalization.
- `qa-scheduled-sleep-node-runtime.md`: restart recovery, initial sleep schema,
  and cancellation-scope decisions for scheduled sleep and shared cron
  scheduling.
- `qa-scheduled-workflow-execution.md`: timezone defaults, missed-run policy,
  schedule CRUD scope, result delivery destination, and startup rehydration
  scope for chat-created workflow schedules.
