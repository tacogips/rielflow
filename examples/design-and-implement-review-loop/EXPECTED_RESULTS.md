# Expected Results

Stable assertions for deterministic verification with the bundled mock scenarios.
Ignore `sessionId`, timestamps, and artifact paths.

## Validate

Command:

```bash
nix run ./divedra -- workflow validate design-and-implement-review-loop
```

Expected result: the workflow is valid.

## Run

Issue-resolution command:

```bash
nix run ./divedra -- workflow run design-and-implement-review-loop \
  --mock-scenario .divedra/workflows/design-and-implement-review-loop/mock-scenario.json \
  --output json
```

Expected stable run summary:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "workflowName": "design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "workflowId": "design-and-implement-review-loop",
  "nodeExecutions": 24,
  "transitions": 23,
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

Expected final output node: `workflow-output`
