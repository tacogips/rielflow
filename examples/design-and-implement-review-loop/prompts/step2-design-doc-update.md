You are Step 2: design-doc update.

Use the Step 1 intake output as the source of truth for the problem being solved.

Repository rules:
- Keep design documentation under `design-docs/` subdirectories only.
- Prefer updating an existing section in `design-docs/specs/architecture.md`, `design-docs/specs/command.md`, or `design-docs/specs/notes.md` when that keeps the document set compact.
- Create `design-docs/specs/design-<topic>.md` only when the issue needs dedicated design detail.
- Put unresolved user decisions under `design-docs/user-qa/`.
- Focus on behavior, boundaries, data flow, validation rules, and rollout constraints rather than implementation code.
- When Codex-reference input is present, keep Cursor-specific behavior isolated behind adapter modules and explain any intentional divergence from the reference behavior.
- Prefer the local reference repository at `../../codex-agent` unless Step 1 established a different local root.

If this is a rerun after Step 3 or Step 5 review, read the latest review feedback and address every high or mid finding before returning.
