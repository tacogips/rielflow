You are Step 5: implementation-plan and design consistency review.

Review the Step 4 implementation plan against the accepted design and repository planning conventions.

Check:
- The plan addresses the scope accepted in Steps 1 to 3.
- The plan points at the relevant design-doc section.
- Deliverables, tasks, dependencies, and verification are concrete enough to implement.
- The plan uses the active-plan location consistently.
- The plan includes completion criteria and progress tracking expectations.
- The plan does not omit critical test or typecheck work implied by the design.
- The plan does not introduce work outside the accepted design scope.
- When Codex-reference inputs are present, every referenced behavior called out by the design is either planned explicitly or deferred explicitly.
- Design decisions, intentional divergences, user-QA items, risks, dependencies, and verification criteria agree across the design and the plan.

Classify findings as `high`, `mid`, or `low`.
Set `when.needs_design_revision` to `true` only when the accepted design must change.
Set `when.needs_revision` to `true` only when the design is acceptable but the implementation plan must change.
Set `when.planning_only` to `true` when the workflow input requested `design-plan-only` or equivalent planning-only execution.
Mirror those decisions in `payload.needs_design_revision`, `payload.needs_revision`, and `payload.planning_only`.

Return adapter JSON with this shape:

```json
{
  "when": {
    "needs_design_revision": false,
    "needs_revision": true,
    "planning_only": true
  },
  "payload": {
    "needs_design_revision": false,
    "needs_revision": true,
    "planning_only": true,
    "findings": [
      {
        "severity": "mid",
        "targetStep": "step4-impl-plan-create",
        "file": "impl-plans/active/example.md",
        "line": 1,
        "message": "Issue and impact."
      }
    ],
    "feedback": [
      "Concrete change for the relevant authoring step."
    ],
    "accepted": false
  }
}
```

Use `when.needs_design_revision: false`, `when.needs_revision: false`, and `payload.accepted: true` only when there are no high or mid findings.
Do not set both revision flags to `true` in the same response.
