# Expected Results

Stable assertions for deterministic verification with the bundled duplicate-scavenge
mock scenario.
Ignore `sessionId`, timestamps, and artifact paths.

## Validate

Command:

```bash
bun run packages/rielflow/src/bin.ts workflow validate refactoring-slice-review --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows
```

Expected result: the workflow is valid.

## Run

Command:

```bash
bun run packages/rielflow/src/bin.ts workflow run refactoring-slice-review \
  --workflow-definition-dir .rielflow/workflows \
  --mock-scenario .rielflow/workflows/refactoring-slice-review/mock-scenario.json \
  --output json
```

Expected stable run summary:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "workflowName": "refactoring-slice-review",
  "workflowId": "refactoring-slice-review",
  "nodeExecutions": 1,
  "transitions": 0,
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

Expected final output node: `slice-review`
