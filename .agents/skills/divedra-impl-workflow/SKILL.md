description: Use when implementation work in this repository changes behavior, adds functionality, or fixes bugs and the user has not explicitly asked to avoid workflows. Routes the work through the project-local divedra workflow `.divedra/workflows/design-and-implement-review-loop`, including design/plan alignment, implementation, review, user-facing documentation refresh, commit-message generation, and built-in git commit/push steps.

# Divedra Implementation Workflow

Use this skill as the default path for implementation work in this repository.

## Apply This Skill When

- fixing a bug
- adding or changing runtime behavior
- implementing a feature from a design or implementation plan
- making a non-trivial refactor that changes implementation behavior
- reviewing or hardening dedicated `workflow self-improve` implementation
  behavior, including its CLI, server, library, GraphQL, report, backup, patch,
  and git-commit integration

## Do Not Apply This Skill When

- the user explicitly says not to use a workflow
- the task is documentation-only or planning-only with no implementation
- the task is specifically to debug or repair `divedra` itself; use `divedra-fix`
- the task is to operate or troubleshoot live `workflow run --auto-improve`
  supervision rather than implement repository behavior; use
  `divedra-auto-improve`

## Default Workflow

Use the project-local workflow bundle:

- Workflow id: `design-and-implement-review-loop`
- Catalog path: `.divedra/workflows/design-and-implement-review-loop`

Preferred entry point from the repository root:

```bash
task divedra-design-implement -- --output json
```

Equivalent direct command:

```bash
nix run .#divedra -- workflow run design-and-implement-review-loop --output json
```

## Runtime Inputs

For normal implementation work, run the workflow in issue-resolution mode.

Pass structured workflow input through `--variables` when the task needs
explicit issue/reference context. Typical fields:

- `workflowInput.issueUrl`
- `workflowInput.issueNumber`
- `workflowInput.issueRepository`
- `workflowInput.issueTitle`
- `workflowInput.issueBody`
- `workflowInput.targetFeatureArea`
- `workflowInput.requestedBehavior`
- `workflowInput.codexAgentReferences`
- `workflowInput.referenceRepositoryRoot`
- `workflowInput.referenceRepositoryUrl`

Planning-only mode is available via:

- `workflowInput.executionMode: "design-plan-only"`

## Expected Behavior

The workflow is responsible for:

1. issue or task intake
2. design-document updates
3. design self-review
4. design review
5. implementation-plan creation or revision
6. implementation-plan self-review
7. implementation-plan review
8. implementation work
9. implementation self-review
10. implementation review
11. user-facing documentation refresh (`README.md`, mandatory workflow skill
    docs, and any directly affected user-facing skills such as event-source
    runbooks)
12. staged secret scan with `gitleaks git --pre-commit --redact --staged --verbose`
13. commit-message generation
14. built-in git commit and git push add-on steps

Because the workflow ends with commit/push, do not use it when the user has
explicitly asked to avoid workflow-driven commits or wants manual local edits
only.

## Reporting

After the workflow finishes, report:

- workflow mode
- changed files
- verification commands
- commit message
- commit hash
- pushed remote and branch

If the workflow fails because `divedra` appears incorrect, switch to the
`divedra-fix` skill.
