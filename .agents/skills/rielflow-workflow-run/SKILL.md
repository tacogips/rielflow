# Rielflow Workflow Run

Use this skill for operating existing rielflow workflows. For installing GitHub workflow directories with `workflow checkout`, use `rielflow-workflow-checkout` instead. For creating or editing workflow bundles, use `rielflow-workflow` instead.

## First Decision

Identify what the user wants:

- Find workflows for human overview: use `workflow list` or `workflow status`.
- Choose a workflow for AI/tool use: use `workflow usage --output json` first.
- Check a workflow before running: use `workflow validate` and optionally `workflow inspect`.
- Run locally: use `workflow run`; for important or long-running work, prefer supervised execution with `--auto-improve`.
- Run a one-off local workflow payload: use `workflow run --workflow-json` or
  `workflow run --workflow-json-file` when the workflow should not be installed
  into project or user scope.
- Run deterministically without real agents: add `--mock-scenario`.
- Monitor an existing run: use `session progress`, `session status`, or GraphQL detail queries.
- Continue a run: use `session resume`.
- Start from a specific step in an existing session: use `session rerun <session-id> <step-id>`.
- Continue from a concrete prior step-run artifact boundary: use `session continue <session-id> --start-step <step-id> --after-step-run <step-run-id>`.
- Inspect merged execution history, logs, and export-shaped diagnostic payloads through GraphQL.
- Use a remote control plane: start or target `serve` and pass `--endpoint`.
- Debug one step locally: use `call-step`.

Read `references/runbook.md` when the task involves sessions, remote endpoints, mock scenarios, event dispatch, auto-improve, or troubleshooting.

## Command Forms

Inside the rielflow source repo, prefer:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts <command>
```

When rielflow is installed, prefer:

```bash
rielflow <command>
```

Use `--workflow-definition-dir <path>` when the workflow definition bundles are not coming from scoped project/user lookup. This option points at a directory containing `<workflow-name>/workflow.json` bundles; it does not control logs, sessions, or artifacts. In this repository, examples use `--workflow-definition-dir ./examples`.

Run a temporary workflow from embedded JSON when the caller has the complete
workflow payload and does not want to install it into a project or user catalog:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run \
  --workflow-json '{"workflow":{"workflowId":"temp-demo","description":"Temporary demo","entryStepId":"main","nodes":[{"id":"main","nodeFile":"nodes/node-main.json"}],"steps":[{"id":"main","nodeId":"main","role":"worker"}]},"nodePayloads":{"nodes/node-main.json":{"id":"main","executionBackend":"codex-agent","model":"gpt-5-nano","promptTemplate":"Return concise JSON.","variables":{}}}}' \
  --output json
```

For larger payloads, put the same embedded bundle shape in one JSON file:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run \
  --workflow-json-file ./temp-workflow.json \
  --output json
```

Temporary workflow payloads must use `{ "workflow": ..., "nodePayloads": ... }`
and embed prompt and related prompt content directly in JSON. Do not use
`promptTemplateFile`, `systemPromptTemplateFile`,
`sessionStartPromptTemplateFile`, `steps[].stepFile`, or node file references
unless the referenced node payload is present in `nodePayloads`. Temporary
workflow flags are local-only source selectors; do not combine them with a
positional workflow target, `--workflow-definition-dir`, `--from-registry`, or
`--endpoint`. Explicit temporary flags take precedence over
`RIEL_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION_DIR`.

JSON output reports `source.scope: "temporary"` and `source.input` as
`"inline-json"` or `"json-file"`. During execution Rielflow writes
`temporary-workflow-payload/input.json`, `normalized.json`, and `metadata.json`
under the run artifact tree. Normal project, user, direct-directory, manifest,
and registry runs must not create this directory. Local `session resume`,
`session rerun`, and history-linked `session continue` reload temporary
sessions from the persisted normalized payload, so they do not depend on the
original inline string or JSON file still existing.

Run a registry workflow without installing it into a scoped catalog by adding
`--from-registry` to `workflow run`. The target can be a package id, including
scoped package ids such as `@scope/name`, a GitHub workflow directory URL, or a
registered shorthand like `<github-owner>/<workflow-dir>` when configured
registries resolve it unambiguously:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <package-id> \
  --from-registry \
  --registry default \
  --branch main \
  --output json
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run \
  https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/main/.rielflow/workflows/<workflow-name> \
  --from-registry \
  --output json
```

Branchless GitHub directory URLs, such as
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/.rielflow/workflows/<workflow-name>`, resolve
the checkout ref from `--branch`, then a matching registered registry default
branch, then the GitHub repository default branch.

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <owner>/<workflow-dir> \
  --from-registry \
  --registry default \
  --output json
```

Registry-backed runs are explicit and local-only. Bare `workflow run <name>`
never fetches from a registry, and `--from-registry` cannot be combined with
`--endpoint`. Rielflow resolves package ids and shorthands through configured
registries, validates package metadata, checksum/integrity, and the workflow
bundle, stages the workflow under a command-owned temporary workflow-definition
directory, then uses the normal local run path. Raw GitHub directory URLs are
allowed without package metadata after workflow-bundle validation and report
reduced `workflow-bundle-only` provenance. JSON output includes
`registrySource` provenance. Temporary registry runs do not write normal
checkout catalog records, mutate project/user catalogs, or install package
skills. Cleanup runs after a terminal session or pre-start failure; paused or
otherwise non-terminal sessions retain the temporary checkout, store retained
run provenance for the session, and report skipped cleanup metadata. Local
`session resume` and `session continue` automatically use the retained checkout
when no explicit `--workflow-definition-dir` is supplied, then remove it and the
retained provenance record after the resumed or continued execution reaches a
terminal status.

Install a public GitHub workflow directory into a scoped catalog with:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow checkout \
  https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/.rielflow/workflows/<workflow-name>
```

Checkout defaults to project scope and installs under
`<project>/.rielflow/workflows/<workflow-name>`. Add `--user-scope` to install
under `~/.rielflow/workflows/<workflow-name>`. The command validates the remote
bundle in staging before writing the destination, rejects duplicates unless
`--overwrite` is set, and records provenance under
`~/.rielflow/workflow-registry/checkouts/<scope>-<workflow-name>.json`.
Do not combine checkout with `--workflow-definition-dir`.

## Standard Run Sequence

For LLM-driven workflow selection, start here:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow usage --workflow-definition-dir ./examples --output json
```

Read each workflow's:

- `description`
- `callable.stepId`
- `callable.role`
- `callable.input`
- `callable.output`
- `steps`

Choose the workflow whose purpose and callable contract match the user's task.
Use `steps` only as a compact stage overview; use `workflow inspect` when
structural debugging detail is needed.

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow list --workflow-definition-dir ./examples
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow validate <workflow-name> --workflow-definition-dir ./examples
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow inspect <workflow-name> \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --output json
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <workflow-name> \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --output json
```

Recommended supervised execution:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <workflow-name> \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --auto-improve \
  --nested-supervisor \
  --max-supervised-attempts 3 \
  --workflow-mutation-mode execution-copy \
  --output json
```

Use this recommended path when the workflow may need retries, stall detection, remediation, or a supervisor workflow to drive recovery. Use plain `workflow run` for quick local checks, deterministic mock runs, or cases where supervision is intentionally disabled.

For deterministic local testing:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <workflow-name> \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --mock-scenario ./examples/<workflow-name>/mock-scenario.json \
  --output json
```

## Session Operations

After `workflow run`, capture the returned `sessionId`.

```bash
bun run src/main.ts session progress <session-id>
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts session status <session-id> --output json
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts session resume <session-id>
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts session rerun <session-id> <step-id>
```

```bash
bun run src/main.ts session continue <session-id> \
  --start-step <step-id> \
  --after-step-run <step-run-id>
```

## User-Safe Defaults

- Validate before running unless the user explicitly asks to skip validation.
- For AI-guided workflow selection, prefer `workflow usage --output json` before `workflow run`.
- Prefer supervised execution with `--auto-improve --nested-supervisor` for real work where failure recovery matters.
- Prefer `--output json` when the result will be parsed, saved, or compared.
- Prefer `--mock-scenario` for demos, tests, and docs because it avoids real backend calls.
- For temporary workflow payloads, prefer `--workflow-json-file` when the JSON
  is large enough that shell quoting would hide validation errors.
- Keep OpenTelemetry message payload export disabled for normal runs. Telemetry
  can be enabled with an OTLP endpoint or `RIELFLOW_OTEL_ENABLED=true`, but
  set `RIELFLOW_OTEL_EXPORT_MESSAGES=true` only for trusted fixtures.
- Do not combine `--mock-scenario` with `--endpoint`; mock scenarios are local-only.
- Use `--working-dir` when workflow execution must happen relative to a specific project directory.
- Use `--artifact-root` and `--session-store` when the user wants isolated runtime state.
- Use `session rerun` when restarting from a step with variables only; use `session continue` only when intentionally importing history up to a concrete prior step-run.

## OpenTelemetry And Jaeger

For a local trace smoke check, start the repository Jaeger stack and point the
OTLP exporter at it:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.jaeger.yaml up -d
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=rielflow OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
  bun run packages/rielflow/src/bin.ts workflow run first-four-arithmetic-pipeline \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --mock-scenario ./examples/first-four-arithmetic-pipeline/mock-scenario.json \
  --output json
docker compose -f compose.jaeger.yaml down
```

## Remote And Server Use

Start the local control plane:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts serve --workflow-definition-dir ./examples
```

Then target it:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts workflow run <workflow-name> \
  --workflow-definition-dir ./examples \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:43173/graphql \
  --output json
```

Remote-capable operations include `workflow run`, `session resume`, and `session rerun`. `call-step` and `session continue` remain local-only; detailed diagnostics are GraphQL queries rather than separate session subcommands.

## Troubleshooting

- If a workflow is not found, check `--workflow-definition-dir`, `RIEL_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION_DIR`, and scope lookup.
- If an AI cannot tell how to call a workflow, run `workflow usage --output json` and inspect the description, compact `steps`, and callable input/output contract.
- If validation fails, fix the workflow bundle before running; do not bypass schema errors for normal usage.
- If a run fails, inspect `session status`, `session progress`, and GraphQL detail queries.
- If backend calls should not happen, rerun with `--mock-scenario` or `--dry-run` when appropriate.
- If paths are surprising, check `--working-dir`, `--artifact-root`, `--session-store`, and the command invocation directory.
