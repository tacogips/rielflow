# Divedra Event Sources

Use this skill for event-driven workflow usage. For direct workflow execution use `divedra-workflow-run`.

Supported local source kinds include webhook/chat, cron, Matrix, Chat SDK,
S3 metadata bridge, and file-change directory watchers. `file-change` sources
run under `events serve`, watch a configured directory, and emit
`file.change.created`, `file.change.modified`, or `file.change.deleted` for
enabled `changeTypes`.

## Common Flow

```bash
divedra events validate --workflow-root <root> --event-root <event-root>
```

```bash
divedra events emit <source-id> \
  --workflow-root <root> \
  --event-root <event-root> \
  --event-file payload.json \
  --mock-scenario <root>/<workflow-name>/mock-scenario.json
```

```bash
divedra events serve --workflow-root <root> --event-root <event-root>
```

Read `references/events-runbook.md` for event roots, local fixtures, receipts, and replay.

## Rules

- Use `--event-root` explicitly unless the repository convention is obvious.
- Use `--mock-scenario` for deterministic local event dispatch.
- Do not combine local mock scenarios with remote `--endpoint`.
- Use `DIVEDRA_EVENTS_READ_ONLY=true` or `--read-only` to validate and persist receipts without dispatch.
- Use `events list` and `events replay` for operator receipt workflows.
